# Pomodoro Timer
going to use readme as a notes page for now:

should be able to clone this project and in google extensions developer portal (chrome://extensions i think) you can go into developer mode, load unpacked, and just click on the folder. right now, i don't know how to make the popup stay open if you click off the extension but the timer should still keep running in the background
